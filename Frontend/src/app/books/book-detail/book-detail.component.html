      While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone
      call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been
      murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As
      Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the
      bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in
      the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet
      ingeniously disguised by the painter. Even more startling, the late
      curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members
      included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a
      breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the
      labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows
      their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.
